# Premint.nft pool

Bar chart to see the disbursement of the NFT's left in the premint pool waiting to be unboxed. 

## Description

I wanted a graphical way to see the disbursement of mint numbers in the premint pool so I built this simple chart. It uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  

## Future Advancements

In the future I would like to be able to click on a bar and have a popup that displays the NFT's.
